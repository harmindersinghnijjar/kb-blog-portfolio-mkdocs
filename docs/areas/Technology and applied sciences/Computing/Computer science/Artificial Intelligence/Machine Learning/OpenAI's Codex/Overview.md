  
OpenAI has released a beta version of their OpenAI Codex system, which is designed to translate natural language into code. This system is the successor to the GPT-3 system and is designed to be more general-purpose and capable of understanding a wider range of programming tasks. The system is currently available for free, but OpenAI plans to eventually charge for access to the API.

The Codex system is a machine learning system that has been trained on a large corpus of code. This training allows the system to learn the syntax and semantics of programming languages, which enables it to translate natural language descriptions of code into working code.
