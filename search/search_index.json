Brain","text":"<p>The Second Brain - A Life-Changing Productivity System</p> <p>0:12 ![[Pasted image 20221005105501.jpg]] The Second Brain method is a system for managing knowledge and ideas that is based on the latest scientific research on how the brain works. It is designed to help you remember what you learn, make connections between ideas, and generate new ideas. The Second Brain method has four steps: 1. Collect: Collect information and ideas from a variety of sources.  2. Organize: Organize information and ideas using a system that works for you.  3. Reflect: Reflect on information and ideas to identify patterns and connections.  4. Create: Create new ideas by combining and expanding on existing ideas.</p> <p>1:22 ![[Pasted image 20221005110004.jpg]] Borrowed creativity is the idea that creativity is all about remixing stuff. This means taking existing ideas and putting your own spin on them to create something new. This can be done by adding your own ideas to an existing idea, or by taking an existing idea and changing it to better suit your needs.</p> <p>2:14 ![[Pasted image 20221005110027.jpg]] Our brains are for having ideas, not for storing them. This means that we should capture our ideas as they come to us so that we can free up our brain power for generating new ideas. To do this, we can use a variety of methods, such as keeping a notebook or using a voice recorder.</p> <p>3:19 ![[Pasted image 20221005110234.jpg]] Ideas can be recycled and reused over time to create new and innovative products or solutions. The process of recycling ideas begins with brainstorming and then evaluating the potential of the ideas that are generated. Once the best ideas are identified, they can be implemented and further refined to create a new product or solution. The benefits of idea recycling include reducing the amount of time and resources required to generate new ideas and increasing the chances of success by reusing proven ideas.</p> <p>4:23 ![[Pasted image 20221005110258.jpg]] If you associate notes with projects, you can easily see which notes are related to which project. This can be helpful when you are working on a project and need to reference notes from previous projects. Additionally, it can help you keep track of your thoughts and progress on a project over time. 5:05 ![[Pasted image 20221005110440.jpg]] Slow burns are important because they allow you to build something over time that is meaningful and significant. This could be a blog, a book, or even just a personal project that you're passionate about. By taking your time and slowly building something up, you're able to create something that is much more substantial than if you tried to do it all at once. Additionally, slow burns help to keep you motivated and excited about your projects, as you can see your progress over time.</p> <p>6:51 ![[Pasted image 20221005110448.jpg]] One of the best ways to learn something new is to start with a wealth of knowledge. When you have a lot of notes from the past, you can start to see patterns and connections that you wouldn't have otherwise. This can help you learn the material more quickly and deeply. 8:01 ![[Pasted image 20221005110650.jpg]] Intermediate packets are pieces of work that are not the final product, but are necessary to complete the final product. They are often used to split up work so that it can be done more slowly and carefully, and to make sure that all the pieces are accounted for.</p> <p>10:06 ![[Pasted image 20221005110818.jpg]] You can only speak on the articles you've published or the content you've created with true authority. Anything outside of that is simply an opinion.</p> <p>11:53 ![[Pasted image 20221005110857.jpg]] When creating notes in Second-brain, it is important to keep your future self in mind. This means creating notes that are clear, concise, and well-organized. Taking the time to do this now will make it much easier for you to find and use the information later on.</p> <p>13:20 ![[Pasted image 20221005110902.jpg]]</p> <p>The second brain is a place where you can organize your ideas and keep track of what you need to do. This is especially important for me because I tend to be a perfectionist and can get bogged down in the details. By keeping my ideas moving, I can stay focused on the task at hand and not get lost in the weeds.</p>"},{"location":"areas/Society%20and%20social%20sciences/Business/Venture%20Capitalism/20221023193946%20Forbe%27s%20AI%2050/","title":"20221023193946 Forbe's AI 50","text":"NAME INDUSTRY

Many factors contribute to comfort in a home, such as the type of flooring, insulation, central heating, air conditioning, etc. While these amenities are typically available in American homes, they may not be as accessible in other parts of the world, such as India. This can make it challenging to maintain a comfortable living environment in countries with extreme weather conditions.</p> <p>Subjects: Housing comfort and the factors that contribute to it.</p> <p>Housing comfort is an essential aspect of life that is often taken for granted. In the United States, various housing options are available to meet the needs of different people. While several options are available in India, housing comfort is not as good as in the United States. This is due to the limited number of housing options and amenities available in India.</p> <p>A few different things can affect how comfortable a house is. One consideration is the type of flooring in the house. In the US, many homes have carpets and rugs, which are softer to walk on and help keep feet warm in the winter. In India, however, many homes have cement or hardwood floors, which can be cold and uncomfortable in the winter. </p> <p>The second factor is insulation. In the US, insulation is typically made of fiberglass, cellulose, or rock wool, while in India, it generally is jute, mineral wool, or sheep's wool. Fiberglass is considered one of the better types of insulation because it is fire-resistant and sustainable. </p> <p>Another factor that contributes to home comfort is the presence of central heating and air conditioning. Homes in the United States are typically built with central heating and air conditioning, which helps to regulate the temperature inside the house and keep it comfortable year-round. This is not always the case in other parts of the world, such as India, where many homes are not equipped with these features, making it challenging to keep the inside of the home comfortable during extreme weather conditions.</p> <p>Overall, housing comfort is an essential aspect of life that is often taken for granted in the United States. Many factors contribute to comfort in a home, such as the type of flooring, insulation, central heating, air conditioning, etc. While these amenities are typically available in American homes, they may not be as accessible in other parts of the world, such as India.

MineDojo has been added on two types of computers: one that uses Ubuntu 20.04 and another that uses Mac OS X. Before you install MineDojo, you must first install some other programs that it needs to work properly. One of these programs is called JDK 8, which is necessary for running the Minecraft backend. To make sure that installing MineDojo does not affect other programs on your computer, it is recommend that you create a new Conda virtual environment to keep everything separate.</p> <p>If you find all of this too difficult, there is a pre-built Docker image that you can use instead. To install MineDojo, all you need to do is follow these simple steps:</p> <p>To install the stable version of MineDojo, you can use a program called \"pip\" by entering the following command:</p> <pre><code>pip install minedojo\n</code></pre> <p>This will download and install MineDojo onto your computer, allowing you to use it for your AI research.</p> <p>%%If you want to install the latest version of MineDojo directly from the main branch of the repository, you can do so by following these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Open a command prompt or terminal on your computer.</li> <li>Enter the command \"git clone https://github.com/MineDojo/MineDojo &amp;&amp; cd MineDojo\" to download the MineDojo repository and navigate to its directory.</li> <li>Enter the command \"pip install -e .\" to install MineDojo onto your computer.</li> </ol> <p>These commands will allow you to download and install the latest version of MineDojo, which may include new features or improvements that are not yet available in the stable version.</p> <p>To ensure that MineDojo has been installed correctly on your computer, you can run the following script:</p> <pre><code>python minedojo/scripts/validate_install.py\n</code></pre> <p>Please note that the initial run of this script may take some time to compile the Java code. Once the compilation is complete, a Minecraft window will appear on your screen, featuring the same gaming interface that human players use.

After that, you write the attribute's name in lowercase, followed by a colon and the data type.</p> <p>1:52  ![[Pasted image 20221013224608.jpg]] In Unified Modeling Language (UML), methods are the behavior-related parts of each class in an object-oriented program. These methods specify how objects in a program interact with each other and how they modify or retrieve data.</p> <p>2:25  ![[Pasted image 20221013224613.jpg]] Visibility refers to the ability of other classes to see or access a given property or class member.</p> <p>3:05  ![[Pasted image 20221013224620.jpg]] The symbols for visibility in UML are the minus sign, the plus sign, the hash, and the tilde.</p> <p>The minus sign indicates that an attribute or method is private, the plus sign indicates that an attribute or method is public, the hash indicates that an attribute or method is protected, and the tilde indicates that an attribute or method has package or default visibility.</p> <p>3:35  ![[Pasted image 20221013224627.jpg]] Private attributes: name, employee ID, phone number, and department. Public method: updating the phone number.</p> <p>5:19  ![[Pasted image 20221013224634.jpg]] Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only functionality.</p> <p>5:29  ![[Pasted image 20221013224640.jpg]] Inheritance is when a child class inherits the attributes and methods of a parent class.</p> <p>5:53  ![[Pasted image 20221013224648.jpg]] An association relationship is a relationship between two classes in which one class is associated with the other.</p> <p>6:23  ![[Pasted image 20221013224657.jpg]] An aggregation relationship is a special type of association that specifies a whole and its parts. In other words, it is a relationship between a group of objects and the individual objects that make up the group.</p> <p>7:04 ![[Pasted image 20221013224705.jpg]] A composition relationship between two classes exists when the child class couldn't exist without the parent class. In other words, the child object is an integral part of the parent object.</p> <p>7:32 ![[Pasted image 20221013224714.jpg]] Multiplicity allows you to set numerical constraints on your relationships.</p> <p>7:48 ![[Pasted image 20221013224718.jpg]] Other types of multiplicity are zero to one, one to many, or a specific number range.</p> <p>8:25 ![[Pasted image 20221013224730.jpg]] The user class consists of attributes for user ID, password, login status, and register date; and a public method for verified login, returning a Boolean.</p> <p>8:50  ![[Pasted image 20221013224734.jpg]] The customer class is a class that inherits from the user class. It has its own specific attributes and methods, like being able to register, login and update the profile.</p> <p>8:59  ![[Pasted image 20221013224738.jpg]] Composition relationships are when the parts cannot exist without the whole. For example, if an instance of the customer class was destroyed, his shopping cart and orders would be lost. They can't exist outside of the customer.</p> <p>9:27  ![[Pasted image 20221013224743.jpg]] Multiplicity is used to indicate how many of one thing are related to another. In the first example, the multiplicity indicates that a customer can have zero or many orders. This means that a customer may never place an order, or they may place multiple orders. </p> <p>9:49  ![[Pasted image 20221013224748.jpg]] In the second example, the multiplicity indicates that each order has one and only one order detail.
