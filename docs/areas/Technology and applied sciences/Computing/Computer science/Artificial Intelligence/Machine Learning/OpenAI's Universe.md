Universe allows an AI [agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent) to use a computer like a human does: by looking at screen pixels and operating a virtual keyboard and mouse. We must train AI systems on the full range of tasks we expect them to solve, and Universe lets us train a single agent on any task a human can complete with aÂ computer.
