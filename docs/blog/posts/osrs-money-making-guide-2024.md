# OSRS Money Making Guide 2024 - How to Earn a Free RuneScape Bond

Help the OSRS community and earn a bond!

[**One Small Wiki Favour**](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:One_Small_Wiki_Favour) is a project to improve the Old School RuneScape Wiki, where wiki users can contribute to a number of ongoing wiki tasks and qualify for receiving in-game rewards, including [bonds](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Old_school_bond 'Old school bond').


**Anyone is welcome to participate**, whether you're completely new to the wiki or you've been here for a while. If you have not edited before, then this is a great time to get involved!


To participate in this project, take a look at the tasks below and find one that looks exciting -- completing any one of them will earn you a share of a bond. Each task has some advice on how to effectively tackle it, but we strongly recommend **joining the [`#oswf-osrs`](https://discord.gg/79D57sU8Ky) channel in our Discord** to coordinate with other editors, discuss the project, and claim your rewards.


## Rules


- You must have a wiki account and cannot be blocked. Anonymous edits will not count. You can sign up for a wiki account at [Special:CreateAccount](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Special:CreateAccount 'Special:CreateAccount').
- The reward for completion of a task will be one [bond](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bond 'Bond') or equivalent [coins](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Coins 'Coins'). If multiple editors contribute to a goal then the prize may be split between them.
- Partial rewards may be awarded for completing part of a task, with a minimum award at 25% of a bond.
- A task must be completed in its entirety before any bonds or partial bonds are awarded for that task.
- If you are awarded a bond or a share of a bond, you can get in contact with one of the project runners on [Discord](https://discord.gg/79D57sU8Ky), and claim it in-game.
- You can claim a maximum of two bonds over each two week period that tasks are active.


## Automatic notifications


To get automatic notifications of new tasks, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/79D57sU8Ky) and subscribe to the [`#oswf-osrs`](https://discord.gg/79D57sU8Ky) channel.

Alternatively, you can build a [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) applet using the [RSS feed](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Special:RecentChanges?hidebots=1&hidecategorization=1&hideWikibase=1&days=14&limit=50&feed=rss) of the recent changes to the wiki. You can then automatically generate a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) page with the new tasks and have them sent to you via text message or email.
