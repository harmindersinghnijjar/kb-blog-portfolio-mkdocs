Certainly! Here is a simple template for a Dreambot script written in Java:
``` Java 
import org.dreambot.api.methods.Calculations;
import org.dreambot.api.script.AbstractScript;
import org.dreambot.api.script.Category;
import org.dreambot.api.script.ScriptManifest;

@ScriptManifest(author = "Your Name", category = Category.OTHER, name = "Script Name", version = 1.0)
public class ScriptTemplate extends AbstractScript {

    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        log("Starting Script Name");
    }

    @Override
    public int onLoop() {
        // Your code goes here

        return Calculations.random(600, 1200);
    }

    @Override
    public void onExit() {
        log("Stopping Script Name");
    }
}

```

This template includes the basic structure of a Dreambot script, including the `onStart()` method which is called when the script is first started, the `onLoop()` method which is called repeatedly while the script is running, and the `onExit()` method which is called when the script is stopped.

To use this template, you will need to fill in the `Category` and `name` fields in the `ScriptManifest` annotation at the top of the script with the appropriate values for your script. You will also need to add your code to the `onLoop()` method, replacing the placeholder `// Your code goes here` with your own code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
