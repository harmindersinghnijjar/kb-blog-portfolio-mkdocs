# RunescapeGPT: A Runescape ChatGPT Bot


## What is RunescapeGPT?

RunescapeGPT is an innovative Python bot that integrates multimodal AI capabilities to automate OSRS gameplay. The bot leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the game's visual and textual context, offering an enhanced experience over traditional color bots. This cutting-edge tool is released as open-source, inviting community collaboration and development. Inspired by the user interface and features of <a href="https://sammichscripts.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SammichScripts</a>' AHK bot, RunescapeGPT represents a pioneering publicly available endeavor in this space.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Integrate a system to always have a variable that reflects the bot's current action.
- **Activity Log and Reporting**: Keep a detailed log of the bot's last movement, including timestamps and the duration between actions, to identify and understand if something unusual occurs.
- **AI-Powered Decision Making**: In the event of anomalies or breaks, the information, including the screenshot, will be sent to an AI model equipped with multimodal capabilities. This model will analyze the situation and guide the bot accordingly.

By implementing these features, RunescapeGPT will become more than just a bot; it will be a sophisticated AI companion that navigates the game's challenges with unprecedented efficiency.
