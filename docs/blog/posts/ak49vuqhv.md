# OSRS Money Making Guide 2024 - How to Earn a Free RuneScape Bond

Help the OSRS community and earn a bond!

<a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:One_Small_Wiki_Favour" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">One Small Wiki Favour</a> is a project to improve the Old School RuneScape Wiki, where wiki users can contribute to a number of ongoing wiki tasks and qualify for receiving in-game rewards, including <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Old_school_bond" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">bonds</a>.

Anyone is welcome to participate, whether you're completely new to the wiki or you've been here for a while. If you have not edited before, then this is a great time to get involved!

To participate in this project, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/79D57sU8Ky" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">#oswf-osrs</a> channel in OSRS Wiki's Discord to coordinate with other editors, discuss the project, and claim your rewards.

## Rules

- You must have a wiki account and cannot be blocked. Anonymous edits will not count. You can sign up for a wiki account at <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Special:CreateAccount" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Special:CreateAccount</a>. 
- The reward for completion of a task will be one <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bond 'Bond'" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">bond</a> or equivalent [coins](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Coins 'Coins'). If multiple editors contribute to a goal then the prize may be split between them.
- Partial rewards may be awarded for completing part of a task, with a minimum award at 25% of a bond.
- A task must be completed in its entirety before any bonds or partial bonds are awarded for that task.
- If you are awarded a bond or a share of a bond, you can get in contact with one of the project runners on <a href="https://discord.gg/79D57sU8Ky" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>, and claim it in-game.
- You can claim a maximum of two bonds over each two week period that tasks are active.

## Automatic notifications

To get automatic notifications of new tasks, you can join the <a href="https://discord.gg/79D57sU8Ky" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer"> Disord</a> and subscribe to the [`#oswf-osrs`](https://discord.gg/79D57sU8Ky) channel.

Alternatively, you can build an <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">IFTTT</a> applet using the <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Special:RecentChanges?hidebots=1&hidecategorization=1&hideWikibase=1&days=14&limit=50&feed=rss" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">RSS feed</a> of the recent changes to the wiki. You can then automatically generate a <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Notion</a> page with the new tasks and have them sent to you via text message or email.
