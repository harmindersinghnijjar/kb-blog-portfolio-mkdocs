Documents allow for more flexible content creation, similar to that of a Google Doc. They are available on the Boss Mode Plan.

Docs should be used for writing longer content, like blog posts, emails, social posts, or books. You'll learn more about how to use docs in a later lesson.

To access documents, click on [Documents](https://app.conversion.ai/docs) on the left-hand tab.
